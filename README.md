# A hackernews clone built using React, Apollo + GraphQL

I am building this project as part of the How To GraphQL tutorial [React & Apollo Tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/)

## How to use it

### 1. Clone repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maffsojah/hackernews-clone/
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
cd hackernews-clone
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the app

```sh
yarn start
```

You can now open your browser and use the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
